The **pagesandbox-template** is a beautiful resource built on top of the [Zero Theme](https://store.vuetifyjs.com/products/zero-theme-pro) with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/installation.html) and [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/).

## Vuetify

Vuetify is an Open Source UI Library that is developed exactly according to Material Design spec. Every component is handcrafted to bring you the best possible UI tools to your next great app. The development doesn't stop at the core components outlined in Google's spec. Through the support of community members and sponsors, additional components will be designed and made available for everyone to enjoy.

The documentation for **Vuetify** is hosted [here](https://vuetifyjs.com/).

***Not all components that are available in this project are part of the theme and may be a default Vuetify component***

## Vuex

Vuex is a state management pattern + library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. It also integrates with Vue's official [devtools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) extension to provide advanced features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.
